                        My friends are my safe. They are the ones who have earned my trust and support over time. 
                        Honestly, I would say my true friends can be counted on the palm of my hand, but that is what makes them special. 
                        They are a small but meaningful part of my life, and here is a glimpse of who they are.

                                I genuinely hope he gets everything he desires and finds exactly what he deserves in life. 
                                He is one of those friends who makes life better just by being there.

                        We grew up together. They have always been there for me in every new stage of life, 
                        and now that we do not see each other as often, I realize it is a true friendship. 
                        We do not need constant contact, but when we reconnect, everything is just as pure and real as it has always been.

                        They are that group of people with whom I do not need to be anything but myself. Even in silence, everything feels right.
